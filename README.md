Realistic Syria -- FSA Foothold
===============================

Overview
--------

The mission starts with a re-enactment of the attempted 2014 Rescue Mission in 
Syria to rescue James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Kayla Mueller.  This event is
one of the first major events where US forces took a direct action in Syria.

The mission takes some liberties as to how the cruise missile air strikes were
delivered.

After the initial air strike, the MIZ file rotates through several randomized
missions that loosely relate to CIA Operation Timber Sycamore, and fictitous 
search-and-destroy or escort/CAS missions.

In addition to randomized missions, a main arc of missions follows three main
subplots:
* Set up a foothold and multiple bases of operation in the area
* Secure resources and infrastructure
* Push out IS forces
* Deal with the Syrian Civil War and Russia stepping in as not so much a proxy
  war

In addition to these, several major Syrian Civil War events are loosely 
followed and modeled. This includes the FSA and other factions in the South 
and North, and Euphrates operations.

Some political levels are modeled, and Russia's involvement and backing Al
Assad are modeled later in the MIZ file as progression is made.

Mission Story Arc
=================

The Mission loosely follows the timeline starting with the capture and 
beheadings of journalists by ISIS/ISIL in 2014. This is followed with US
intervention and involvement. From there, operations are very loosely 
based on real confilcts from 2014 through 2024 in roughly cronological order.

In addition to the primary story arc, a series of operations allows the
player base to get additional bases of operation in place.  These beachhead
operations are randomized in order.

Securing infrastructure items such as dams and power plants are also
randomized in order.

Finally, there are repeating destabilization operations that occur in
random order.

file.
