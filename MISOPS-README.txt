Briefing Text
=============

### Server Briefing

```
The political sphere is charged as ISIS/ISIL take over most of Syria.  

Assad's Syrian Arab Armed Forces (SAAF) fight on multiple fronts with the Free 
Syrian Army (FSA) to the south, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) 
to the North, and ISIS/ISIL cells throughout Syria. ISIL has claimed from Idlib
Governorate's South Eastern reaches and Aleppo through Raqqa and most of East
Syria into Iraq.

ISIL has just adbucted James Foley and other non-combatants. Take part in the
operations to free these non-combatants and push ISIS/ISIL out of Syria as
well as assist the SDF and FSA in victory over Assad's regime.

Be ready for other states to take a more active part as combat shifts from
a proxy war into a full push to remove ISIS/ISIL out of Syria. Be ready for
Russian forces to assist the SAAF. Be aware of where the areas of operation
are, as not all RedFOR and BlueFOR are the same. Avoid escalating into an all
out war with Russia as forces work in close proximity.



Realistic Syria -- FSA Foothold

details are passed onto ISIL/ISIS, numerous catastrophic scenarios may unfold.

Ensure minimal collatoral damage and zero civilian casualties. Use the Initial
and Secondary Unit Contact points to establish tracking. As a secondary 
option, visual intercept of the vehicle in points Alpha or Bravo can be
performed. Wait until the vehicle is not in populated areas on the road to
terminate. Do not terminate within population centers. Do not engage with
non-precision weapons.
