MISOP-001 - Akirshi Jailbreak Freedom
=====================================

Operation: Akirshi Jailbreak Freedom

ISIL has captured a number of civilians and is threatening to kill these
captives. A rescue operation is in progress. Important intel from a British
national recently released has given us a location where these hostages are 
being held.

Air strikes of Tamohawk missiles are inbound from a strike fleet in the 
Mediteranean. Impacts are expected to occur at approximately 0710hrs local 
time in the AO and neutralize existing insurgent threats.

4 UH-60s carrying a ground strike force is inbound to the AO from our base of
operation running out of the Sanliurfa abandoned air strip just north of the
Syrian border. The strike force is expected to land near the AO at roughly
0720hrs local time.

2 Predator UAVs and a C130 Gunship will be on station to provide assistance.

Additional CAS support provided by additional sorties will be on station as
is available.

MISOP-003 - Operation Ocean Anvil
=================================

Operation: Ocean Anvil

Intelligence reports indicate that a shipment coming in through the Med will
contain contraband and insurgence support materials. This shipment must be
intercepted and the convoy sunk in deep waters. Only engage within the AO
Zone.

The convoy is expected to only be civilian ships, but may have additional
support craft that we are not aware of.

If the convoy is able to leave the AO and continue east to harbor, the
operation will be considered a failure. Intercept those ships before they 
leave the AO.

MISOP-005 - Operation Bronze Rhino
==================================

Operation: Bronze Rhino

A high value target is on the move in a Tigr armored vehicle. Intelligence
reports indicate an expected travel route, the expected initial point of
travel, and two expected stop zones indicated as Intercepts Alpha and Bravo.

The target may be in possession of critical US operations details. If these
details are passed onto ISIL/ISIS, numerous catastrophic scenarios may unfold.

Ensure minimal collatoral damage and zero civilian casualties. Use the Initial
and Secondary Unit Contact points to establish tracking. As a secondary 
option, visual intercept of the vehicle in points Alpha or Bravo can be
performed. Wait until the vehicle is not in populated areas on the road to
terminate. Do not terminate within population centers. Do not engage with
non-precision weapons.

ally territory of Israel. Israel officials have already given their blessing
for US operations from the location.

A CH-47 Chinook out of Muwaffaq Salti is being dispatched with a minimal
securing force to secure the base. Provide air coverage as necessary.
